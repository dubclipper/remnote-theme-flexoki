# Flexoki Theme for [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com)

[Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) is an awesome inky color scheme developed by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com) that is meant to be minimalist and high-contrast.

Although I started creating this theme out of frustration due to the barren wasteland that is RemNote light themes, I decided to have it also support dark mode.  I think it looks great either way and find myself switching back and forth frequently!

I love the Montserrat font so that's the main font used, along with a healthy amount of spacing between the lines.  The document title and headings are using Montaga.  I'm wanting to make the headings distinctive without relying so much on font size or colors so I'm playing around with using serif fonts like this to see if it contrasts enough with the Montserrat (a sans serif font).  It just bothers me when H1 is as prominent as the document title!  I'm weird that way.

I have built this theme with using a desktop or laptop in mind.  It seems to be working fine on mobile but I mainly just do flashcards there.  Anyway, let me know if you run into any issues via the github page!
